# TopTechStocks_Analysis
Hey there   

I analyzed data from 13 stocks using python and PowerBI. These files were available at kaggle and I had to combine them in order to analyze them.    

Tech stack for this project:   

*Python 3 (pandas , pandas profiling , statistics module)  
*BI tools (Power BI)  
*Excel   
*BA case solving skills  

I have given my best to understand Intel's buisness performance according to IVY case system and according to Marc P Consentino's Case in point 11 book.   

Please note that this is my first attempt at BA and as such , I welcome constructive criticism as well.
